* Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience,
and any goals that you may have.

* Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer 
must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by
normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase()
functions). Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting
 them with a response.

 *Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, 
 comment out (donâ€™t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete 
 the project.
